## Data structures
This blog is a continuation of the latest blog on programming and data structures.
I believe data structure is taught to all computer science undergraduate students. Though there is much variation in the way, it is taught. Some view the course as a gentle introduction 
to algorithms, and theoretical underpinning is more important than implementation issues. Perhaps, the thinking behind it is that the introductory programming course has already been 
taught to the students. So, students know how to code. They can manage to write programs without being told to implement data structures. The theory is more important as knowing how to 
analyze code would make them realize efficient coding is more important than just coding. The argument seems to be very strong and elementary to understand. However, the important point 
it misses is that the introductory programming course emphasizes learning syntax and the meaning of the programming constructs. Though efficiency issues are touched, they are not 
discussed in depth. Building and learning clean programming skills are more important than understanding programmatic manipulation of complex data structures.

Furthermore, an introductory programming course is a requirement across disciplines. Apart from Computer Science and Engineering students, it includes other streams such as Electrical, 
Mechanical, Chemical, Material Science and Engineering, Maths, Physics, Chemistry and Biological Sciences. So the course is not designed exclusively for programming as CSE students are 
expected in the future. Therefore, without programming practice in the data structure course, I believe students of CSE tend to develop code phobia. The theory is required, but a right 
balance is needed.

I plan to create a set of posts on various data structures in future blogs.
