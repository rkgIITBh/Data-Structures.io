## Graphs

Any type of relationship between objects or things can be represented using graphs. Suppose we want to
pictorially represent the relationship such as siblings (brothers or sisters) among a set of six people.
We can denote each person by a small point or bubble as shown in the figure below. For conveninence the
bubbles are labeled as <i>a, b, c, d, e, f</i>. To express the sibling relationship between <i>a</i> 
and <i>b</i>, we draw a line connecting the corresponding bubbles.

The concept graph is very generic. We can use bubble to denote different things and link between bubbles
for different relations. For convenience we use the term vertex for a bubble and the line joining two 
vertices as an edge. The graph shown in the figure above could represent different relationship depending 
on the context we use. 

- Vertices may represent computers then the edges represent if a pair of computers are directly connected. 
- Vertices may represent
