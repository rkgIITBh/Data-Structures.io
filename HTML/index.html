<h1>Stack as an ADT</h1>
Stack allows insertions and deletions in one end. After a sequence of insertions, if we delete the elements on by one it outs the elements in reverse order. 
Due to reverse sequencing of the elements on deletions, a stack is also known as Last In, First Out (LIFO) list. Considering a stack as an ADT, the following
operations are important:
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Create an empty stack that will store elements of a given type.</li>
  <li>Insert a new element into an existing stack with the same element type. It may lead to overflow if the stack is already full.</li>
  <li>Remove the top element from an existing stack. It may lead to underflow if the stack is empty.</li>   
</ul>
<br>
<pre>
// Operations on the universe of all queues of element type
new<element type> : -> stack<element type> // Creating a stack
empty<element type> : stack<element type> -> Boolean
isFull<element type>: stack<element type> -> Boolean
pop<element type> : stack<element type> -> <element type> X stack<element type> // Modifier
push<element type> : stack<element type> x <element type> -> stack<element type> // Modifier

// Exception

overflow -> full stack // Occurs on attempt to insert into full stack
underflow -> empty stack // Occurs on attempt to remove from empty stack
  </pre>
<br>
<br>
After formulating ADT, the programmatic implementation of the stack becomes extremely simple. Apart from creating a space for storing elements, we need to keep track of the top. The storage may be created using an array or a linked list. The top is just the index of the last element if the stack elements are held in an array. If stack storage is a linked list, the top should be a pointer to the last incoming element. 
<br>

We end this blog with a C-structure of a stack using an array.  
<br>
<pre>
typedef struct stack {
      int *info;
      int limit; // Capacity of stack
      int top; // Index of the last incoming element
} STACK;
  </pre>
	<br>
	<br>
Now STACK can be used as a type for implementing stack operations.

<br>
The next blog will deal with stack operations.
