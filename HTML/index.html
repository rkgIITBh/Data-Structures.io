<h1>Stack as an ADT</h1>
Stack allows insertions and deletions in one end. So, following a sequence of insertions, deletions produce the elements in reverse order. Due to reverse sequencing of the elements on deletion, a stack is also known as last in the first out list (LIFO). Considering a stack as an ADT, the following operations are important:

<ul>
  <li>Create an empty stack that will store elements of a given type.</li>
  <li>Insert a new element into an existing stack with the same element type. It may lead to overflow if the stack is already full.</li>
  <li>Remove the top element from an existing stack. It may lead to underflow if the stack is empty.</li>   
</ul>

<code>
// Operations on the universe of all queues of element type
<br>
new<element type> : -> stack<element type> // Creating a stack
<br>
empty<element type> : stack<element type> -> Boolean
<br>
full<element type>: stack<element type> -> Boolean
<br>
pop<element type> : stack<element type> -> <element type> X stack<element type> // Modifier
<br>
push<element type> : stack<element type> x <element type> -> stack<element type> // Modifier
<br>
<br>
// Exception
<br>
overflow -> full stack // Occurs on attempt to insert into full stack
<br>
underflow -> empty stack // Occurs on attempt to remove from empty stack
  </code>
<br>
After formulating ADT, the programmatic implementation of the stack becomes extremely simple. Apart from creating a space for storing elements, we need to keep track of the top. The storage may be created using an array or a linked list. The top is just the index of the last element if the stack elements are held in an array. If stack storage is a linked list, the top should be a pointer to the last incoming element. 


We end this blog with a C-structure of a stack using an array.  
<code>
<br>
typedef struct stack {
<br>
      int *info;
<br>
      int limit; // Capacity of stack
<br>
      int top; // Index of the last incoming element
<br>
} STACK;
<br>
  </code>
	<br>
Now STACK can be used as a type for implementing stack operations. 


The next blog will deal with stack operations.
