## Sorting Algorithms

We have used sorting in various context in some of the previous blogs. Some operations on linked
lists become efficient if the lists are mainted in sorted order. Searching an element in a list
becomes efficient if the list is sorted. However, we have not considered the problem of sorting
itself. A list may be presented as collection of elements in any order, not necessarily in a
sorted order.So, the question is: how do we get a sorted list in the first place? There are many
sorting algorithms. We can classify them in following classes:

- Sorting by number of comparison
- Sorting by number of swaps
- Sorting by number of data movements
