## Sorting Network

A sorting network consists of wiring of primitive devices called comparators. A comparator has two input
wires and two output wires. Figure 1 shows a max comparator with its input and output wires. Input signals 
<i>x</i> and <i>y</i> are fed into the comparator. It emits signals <i>x' = max(x, y)</i> and 
<i>y' = min(x, y)</i> on the output wires. The output from a min comparator reverse the output signals.
