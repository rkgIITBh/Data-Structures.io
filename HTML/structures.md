## Meaning of Structure

A structure defines an arrangement of the components or parts organized in a pattern to form something complex. The Cambridge dictionary says that a structure's meaning is to organize a 
system's elements or an object. For example, the grammatical structure of a sentence consists of a noun phrase and a verb phrase.  A noun phrase comprises of a group of words that 
behave like a noun. A noun phrase essentially acts as a bridge for a coordinated list to its left and a base noun phrase to its right. A verb phrase consists of the main verb and an 
auxiliary verb. It may, for example indicate tense, mood or a person. The words are basically arranged in the framework of a noun phrase and a framework of verb phrase. A structure may 
also represent a skeletal scaffolding building, walls, fences, billboards, and poster panel. A structure consists of parts that reinforce the holding of a complex object. The purpose of 
reinforcement is to provide strengths so that operating with the complex object becomes easy. DNA molecule, for example, is held by a helical structure.  

Having understood the function of structure, we may think of data structure as an organization of raw data in a framework that is easy to operate. The operations performed on data could 
be insertion, deletion, search, and retrieval. Bit strings represent raw data. Programming languages offer some form of basic organization over bit strings represented by native data 
types such as integer, float, characters, double, etc. So, data types are variables that are assigned values directly. As opposed to this, data structure provides a framework for 
organizing data that facilitates efficient operations. Mutating operations modify data and also structure of data. Nonmutating operations are just retrieval.
