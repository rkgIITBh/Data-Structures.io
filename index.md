## Learning Data Structures & Programming

Programming and data structure are two critical elements in building a career as a software techie. India boasts of many 
software companies like TCS, Infosys, HCL Technologies, Mindtree, Tech Mahinda, L&T infotech, ITC infotech, First source, etc. I 
understand that all of these companies have in-house training units. They induct graduate trainees and put them through rigorous 
coding training before induction. Many of the trainees cannot cope up the rigor and leave in the middle.


The problem lies in background and preparation. There is a gap in demand and supply as far as the availability of the coders is 
concerned. Most placements happen based on the intrinsic capabilities of the students rather than their abilities to code. The 
companies would like to recruit only graduates from known institutions rather than graduates with coding capabilities. The idea 
is that if the students have a good attitude, they can learn quickly and become productive quite soon. Yet, the companies would 
still prefer the graduates who can be productive from day 1. In-job training is only possible for short durations like a week or 
two or three weeks. With this in mind, most companies will prefer undergraduates with good aptitude and have 
received enough programming and data structures training. So, in this blog, I address the issue of training in programming 
and data structures. Let me address these issues one at a time. The first is the choice of programming language. 


I remember that a few of our colleagues in the department were excited about Java and ignored the saner voices to introduce Java for teaching programming to the first-year students. They argued that Java can enable students to learn network programming. The students may use embedded graphics and multimedia in programs and create useful utilities that excite them. 


Unfortunately, it turned out to be a disastrous experiment, as three of the other faculty members, including me, predicted. The 
student counselor told us that some students could not comprehend the lectures in the class, which focused mainly on teaching 
objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and object manipulation to students who never had any previous coding experience. 
None of the topics like network programming or embedding graphics, audio or video can be covered in a one-semester course. It was 
wishful thinking on the colleagues who insisted on the experiment of introducing Java as the first programming language course. I 
still remember that our opinions were treated in a patronizing manner "oh, you don't know" or "I can't believe you don't 
understand." The result was that many students sought help from city coaching centers to complete programming assignments. Since 
the first programming course is compulsory for all engineering students across disciplines, professors from other departments 
were very upset with the dept of CSE for carrying out such a disastrous experiment on the students. Finally, after six 
semesters, we reverted to C. C with all its peculiarities still the most preferred language for teaching programming if we 
carefully avoid the tricks.


Of late, some university depts have started using Python. Python is catching up quickly as the preferred choice for teaching programming 
courses. However, if my memory serves me correctly, perhaps PASCAL was taught until 2000 to the students in IIT Kanpur. It is pedagogically t
he best programming language, as it is the closest implementation of algorithms into code.  


As far as Python is concerned, the three major advantages are:
- Creating Python programs take significantly less time than programming either in Java or in C++ or C.
- Python programs are shorter than the equivalent programs in Java or C++ because of dynamic typing and built-in types.
- A large set of highly useful libraries are available that support Python programs' easy use. 

Most leading universities in the US, including MIT, CMU, Berkeley, UIUC teach Python as the first programming language course ( 
Esther Shein , Python for Beginners, CACM, vol 58, no. 3). 


IIT Bhilai is carrying out an exciting experiment. It has started to teach web programming using Python and Flask at an 
introductory level. I am not sure about the students' reactions. But the idea is entirely novel. It is expected to achieve two 
things. First, the students will be excited to see that their programs can be both helpful and available. After all, one learns 
to create software that others will use, and most users will use it over the internet through a public server. So, 
I believe the approach is likely to have greater acceptance among the students. Pedagogically, it will not be a major shift from 
teaching Python. However, it has an added advantage of students learning HTML, CSS, Flask, and Python. Teaching Python through a web 
programming approach came from Rajat Moona, the incumbent director of IIT Bhilai. Since the faculty at IIT Bhilai is young, they 
enthusiastically supported it.  


I believe data structure is taught to all computer science undergraduate students. Though there is much variation in the way it is taught. Some view the course 
as a gentle introduction to algorithms, and theoretical underpinning is more important than implementation issues. Perhaps, the thinking behind it is that the 
introductory programming course has already been taught to the students. So, students know how to code. They can manage to write programs without being told to 
implement data structures. The theory is more important as knowing how to analyze code would make them realize efficient coding is more important than just 
coding. The argument seems to be very strong and elementary to understand. However, the important point it misses is that the introductory programming course 
emphasizes learning syntax and the meaning of the programming constructs. Though efficiency issues are touched, they are not discussed in depth. Building and 
learning clean programming skills are more important than understanding the programmatic manipulation of complex data structures.

Furthermore, an introductory programming course is a requirement across disciplines. Apart from Computer Science and Engineering 
students, it includes other streams such as Electrical, Mechanical, Chemical, Material Science and Engineering, Maths, Physics, 
Chemistry and Biological Sciences. So the course is not designed exclusively for programming as CSE students are expected in the 
future. Therefore, without programming practice in the data structure course, I believe students of CSE tend to develop code 
phobia. The theory is required, but a proper balance is needed.
